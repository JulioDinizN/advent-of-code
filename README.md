# Advent of Code Repository

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming event with a series of puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Starting December 1st and running through December 25th, a new puzzle is released daily at midnight (Eastern Time). Each puzzle is holiday-themed and provides an excellent opportunity to hone your problem-solving and programming skills.

### Why Participate?
- Enhance your coding skills.
- Learn new techniques, algorithms, and data structures.
- Engage with a vibrant community of developers.
- Have some festive fun while coding!

## Repository Structure

This repository organizes solutions by year, with each year further subdivided by the programming languages used to solve the puzzles.

### Folder Structure for Each Year
Each year has folders for different programming languages, and within each language folder:
- **Day folders** (`Day01`, `Day02`, etc.) contain:
  - `input.txt`: The input data for that day's puzzle.
  - `solution.<language>`: The solution implemented in the respective programming language.
  - `README.md`: A brief explanation of the puzzle and the approach to solving it.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Browse the folder corresponding to the year and programming language of interest.
2. Explore the solutions for each day.
3. Compare your solutions or gain inspiration for your own attempts.

## Participate in the Challenge
